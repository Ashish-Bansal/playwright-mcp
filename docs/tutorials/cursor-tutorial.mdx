You've set up **Cursor and Playwright MCP**, and now it's time to **let AI write your Playwright tests the right way**. In this guide, we'll take you through writing an **end-to-end Playwright test for MakeMyTrip** search using Cursor—without manually handling selectors or debugging flaky AI-generated code.

By the end of this, you'll know how to:

- Open a browser using Cursor chat
- Interact with a website and capture test steps
- Add extra context to make the test smarter
- Extract the right DOM elements
- Generate a complete, AI-assisted Playwright test case

If you're tired of manually writing test scripts, let Cursor do the work for you. Let's get started.

---

## **Before you begin: Check If Playwright MCP is Installed**

Before anything else, make sure **Playwright MCP is installed on your Cursor IDE**.

- Once installed, you'll see a **tool icon** in Cursor. Click it.
- This will bring up a list of **available Playwright MCP tools**. Check the screenshot reference to see what to expect.
- If you don't see the tools, head over to the [installation guide](/#installation-get-up-and-running-in-no-time) and set it up first.

## **Let's Start Writing an End-to-End Playwright Test**

We're going to write a **full Playwright test for MakeMyTrip Search**. Instead of manually writing selectors and hoping they work, we'll let Cursor **watch our interactions, record them, and generate the test for us**.

---

## **Step 1: Open a Playwright-Controlled Browser**

To begin, we need a browser window that **Cursor can see and interact with**.

<img src={require('@site/static/img/cursor-init-browser.png').default} alt="Initialize Browser in Cursor" className="img-responsive" />

1. In Cursor chat type:
    
    ```
    Browser init
    ```
    
2. Since this tool requires a URL, Cursor will ask you to enter one.
3. Enter the **MakeMyTrip** website:
    
    ```
    makemytrip.com
    ```
    
4. Cursor will ask for permission to run the tool. **Allow it.**
5. Once approved, a browser window will open.

At this point, you can start **interacting with the MakeMyTrip website** just like you would manually.

### Step 2: Record Your Interactions

Here's where the magic happens. After you click "Start recording", and start using the website - clicking, searching, filling out forms - **Cursor will record every action.**

Look at the **right-hand side of Cursor's interface**. You'll see every step you take being logged in real-time.

This means no more:

1. Manually writing test steps
2. Guessing which selectors to use
3. Debugging flaky AI-generated test cases

Everything you do is **automatically turned into Playwright test steps**.

<img src={require('@site/static/img/browser-recording.png').default} alt="Recording Browser Actions" className="img-responsive" />

### **Step 3: Add Extra Context (The Secret Sauce for Better Tests)**

<img src={require('@site/static/img/browser-get-dom.png').default} alt="Getting DOM Context" className="img-responsive" />

Most test recording tools just **capture actions** but don't **understand what's actually happening** on the page.

Cursor, however, can **generate smarter test cases** if we provide extra context.

1. At the **bottom-right corner**, you'll see a **plus (+) icon**. Click it.
2. Select **DOM**.
3. Now, **choose a specific part of the page** that's important for the test.

By doing this, you're telling Cursor:

- Which elements actually matter in your test
- Which selectors to focus on
- How to make your Playwright test **more reliable and accurate**

Once you've selected a DOM section, you'll see **the extracted HTML appear below your recorded steps**. This ensures that **Cursor picks the best possible selectors instead of making AI guesses**.

## **Step 4: Extract Context for the Final Test Case**

<img src={require('@site/static/img/cursor-get-context.png').default} alt="Getting Test Context in Cursor" className="img-medium" />

Now that recording is complete, it's time to give Cursor **all the information it needs** to write a rock-solid Playwright test.

1. **Go to Cursor and ask it to write the test case.**
2. Instead of immediately generating a test case, Cursor will need **more context from your recorded interactions**.
3. Ask Cursor to **call another tool**, either:
    
    ```
    get context
    ```
    
4. This tool will **retrieve all recorded interactions along with the exact HTML component that you selected earlier**.

At this point, Cursor will **describe all interactions it captured**.

- It will list the actions you performed.
- It will show **the selected elements with their context**.

Now, Cursor has **everything it needs to generate a Playwright test that actually works**.

## **Step 5: Ask Cursor to Write the Playwright Test Case**

<img src={require('@site/static/img/cursor-generate-testcase.png').default} alt="Generate Test Case in Cursor" className="img-responsive" />


The last step is simple:

1. **Ask Cursor:**
    
    ```
    Using the context, help me write a Playwright test case for e2e testing.
    ```
    
2. Cursor will analyze the recorded interactions, extracted DOM, and selectors.
3. It will generate a **fully automated Playwright test**.

You'll see how Cursor **writes a clean, structured Playwright test** based on your recorded session.

This is **not just another AI-generated script**—this is a **fully usable, highly accurate Playwright test with validated selectors and reliable interactions**.

---

## **What Happens Next?**

You now have a complete test case. Here's what to do next:

1. **Copy the generated Playwright test code** and add it to your test suite.
2. **Run it with Playwright** using:
    
    ```
    npx playwright test
    ```
    
3. **Fine-tune selectors or assertions** if needed.

And that's it. You've just written an **end-to-end Playwright test using Cursor and Playwright MCP—without manually writing a single selector.**

---

## **Why This Changes Everything for Playwright Testers**

Writing Playwright tests **manually** is slow, tedious, and prone to errors.

With `playwright-mcp`, you:

- **Record actual interactions** instead of guessing test steps
- **Extract the real DOM** instead of using unreliable selectors
- **Generate full test cases** instead of writing them from scratch
- **Validate selectors before running tests**, so they don't break unexpectedly

This isn't just another AI tool that **sort of helps**. This is an AI-powered test assistant that actually **understands your web page and writes accurate, reusable tests**.

### Bonus:

Here is a more descriptive prompt for you to use: 

```jsx
## DON'T ASSUME ANYTHING. Whatever you write in code, it must be found in the context. Otherwise leave comments.

    ## Goal
    Help me write playwright code with following functionalities:
    - [[add semi-high level functionality you want here]]
    - [[more]]
    - [[more]]
    - [[more]]

    ## Reference
    - Use @x, @y files if you want to take reference on how I write POM code

    ## Steps
    - First fetch the context from `get-context` tool, until it returns no elements remaining
    - Based on context and user functionality, write code in POM format, encapsulating high level functionality into reusable functions
    - Try executing code using `execute-code` tool. You could be on any page, so make sure to navigate to the correct page
    - Write spec file using those reusable functions, covering multiple scenarios
```

This prompt will also make sure that the selectors are working(A problem we face with LLM based tests a lot). 

Now that you understand how to write a basic test case, head over to [advanced features](/features) for more advanced usage. 

Happy coding!
